Problem Statement - 
AtliQ Hardware, a rapidly growing consumer electronics company with operations in multiple countries, faces significant challenges due to its reliance on Excel files for data analytics. While Excel provides basic functionalities, it falls short in handling the growing volume, complexity, and scalability required for effective decision-making in a competitive global market. The lack of advanced analytics and real-time insights has limited AtliQ Hardware's ability to identify market trends, optimize operations, and implement data-driven strategies.

This inefficiency led to a major revenue loss in the Latin American market, highlighting the critical need for modern analytics solutions. The company requires a robust data analytics infrastructure to enable better visualization, faster insights, and improved decision-making capabilities to sustain growth and remain competitive in the global market.
